                        <p>As this is just a static site I didn't feel the need to implement it using any fancy framework. Just some lightweight HTML, CSS and Javascript. &#128512</p>

                          The site is SSL/TLS enabled on the Nginx instance using Let'sEncrypt certs installed with CertBot. The cert is auto-renewed using a CronJob.
                          HTTP/2 has been enabled and a server push is done for the static content and scripts when index.html is requested.

                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>I'm Adriaan.</p>
                    <p>I'm a Software Engineer living in Ireland currently working with Bank of America in the Global Risk Analytics team.</p>
                    <p>
                        I reached the world of computing/technology after meandering through the world of music and music production for a while.
                        I've always had a great interest in computing building my first PC when I was 15 and ever since then I've wanted to learn more and more about computers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I initially went to college to study Music Production and, after doing some audio programming, I was hooked into the world of software and its capabilities.
                        So I strapped in for another few years of college, studying Software Development in I.T Carlow, Ireland. I haven't looked back since!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I secured my first internship in year 3 of college in the Global Risk Analytics team where I got my first taste of being a software engineer.
                        There, I had the pleasure of working with some of the smartest people I know.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I graduated from college 2019, rejoined Bank of America and I've learned new skills every day since.
