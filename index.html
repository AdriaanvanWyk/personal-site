                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>I'm Adriaan.</p>
                    <p>I'm a software engineer living in Ireland currently working with Bank of America in the Global Risk Analytics team.</p>
                    <p>
                        I reached the world of computing/technology after meandering through the world of music and music production for a while.
                        I've always had a massive interest in computing building my first PC when I was 15 and ever since then I've wanted to learn more and more about them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I initially went to college to study music production and, after doing some audio programming, I was hooked into the world of software and its capabilities.
                        So I strapped in for another few years of college, studying Software Development in I.T Carlow, Ireland. I haven't looked back since!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I secured my first internship in year 3 of college in the Global Risk Analytics team where I got my first taste of being a software engineer.
                        There, I had the pleasure of working with some of the smartest people I know.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I graduated from college last year, rejoined Bank of America and I've learned new skills everyday since.
                    </p>
